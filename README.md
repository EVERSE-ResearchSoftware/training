# Training

A collection of training resources related to research software quality and general software and data skills from different research domains and infrastructures collected as part of the EVERSE project.

The [working spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ufa4M024k2GeRzP9t64_P9uofXePyGRRf7LOF5vRWTg/edit?gid=395425751#gid=395425751) is used as a living document to constantly add and update training resources 
the content of which is then periodically released in this repository.

## Documents

- [MS15 milestone report "Mapping of the stocktake of training materials across the training initiatives in the research communities of WP4 and a first assessment on gaps to be filled"](https://certhgr.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/INAB-CERTH-Bioinformatics/Shared%20Documents/General/04.Projects/EU-Projects/Funded-Running/EVERSE%20(HORIZON-INFRA-2023-EOSC-01-02)/Consortium/3.Deliverables%20and%20Milestones/final-submitted/WP5/MS15_WP5_Mapping%20of%20the%20stocktake%20of%20training%20materials%20across%20the%20training%20initiatives%20in%20the%20research%20communities%20of%20WP4%20and%20a%20first%20assessment%20on%20gaps%20to%20be%20filled.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=RUGzm5 )
- [March 2025 GAM workshop spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ufa4M024k2GeRzP9t64_P9uofXePyGRRf7LOF5vRWTg/edit?gid=1045877253#gid=1045877253) - based on the MS15 report above, we started currating trianing resources further (based on reseach domain, resource type, software quality dimension they address)
- [Current working spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ufa4M024k2GeRzP9t64_P9uofXePyGRRf7LOF5vRWTg/edit?usp=sharing) - we are using this sheet for ongoing curration and collecting of training resources
